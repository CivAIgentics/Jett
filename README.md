### Adding Features

1. **Custom Knowledge Base**: Update ElevenLabs agent configuration
2. **Analytics**: Integrate with Google Analytics or custom solution
3. **Multi-language**: Add language detection and translation
4. **Authentication**: Add user authentication if needed

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Never commit `.env` file to version control
2. **CORS**: Restrict `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to trusted domains only
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for production
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy headers are configured
6. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Logs

Application logs are output to console. In production, consider:
- Log aggregation (e.g., Loggly, Papertrail)
- Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Avatar not loading
- Check ANAM_PERSONA_ID is correct
- Verify ANAM AI account is active
- Check browser console for errors

**Issue**: Voice not working
- Verify ELEVENLABS_API_KEY and ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Ensure HTTPS is used (required for microphone access)

**Issue**: CORS errors
- Add your domain to ALLOWED_ORIGINS in .env
- Verify server is restarted after .env changes

**Issue**: WebSocket connection fails
- Check firewall allows WebSocket connections
- Verify reverse proxy is configured for WebSocket upgrade
