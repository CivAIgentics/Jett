# Voice Link Navigation - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What's New?

Jacky 3.0 can now **open web links for you** when you ask! Just say what you want to open, and Jacky will take you there.

## 🗣️ How to Use It

### Method 1: Say the Service Name
Just tell Jacky what you want to open:

```
✅ "Open water account"

✅ "Show me building permits"
✅ "Go to trash service"
✅ "Visit the police department"
✅ "Open parking tickets"
```

### Method 2: Use "Take Me There"
After Jacky shows you a service card, simply say:

```
✅ "Take me there"
✅ "Open that"
✅ "Open it"
✅ "Go there"
✅ "Yes, take me"
✅ "Open link"
```

## 🌍 Works in Spanish Too!

```

```

## 📋 Example Conversations

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: "Open water bill payment" works better than just "water"

2. **Use natural language**: Don't worry about exact wording - Jacky understands variations

3. **Multiple cards?** When Jacky shows several cards, say "the first one" or be more specific

4. **Check the card first**: Service cards show the URL before opening, so you know where you're going

5. **Pop-up blocker**: If links don't open, check your browser's pop-up settings

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: Link didn't open**
- Make sure pop-up blocker allows jacky-3-0.vercel.app
- Try clicking the link manually on the card
- Refresh the page and try again

**Q: Wrong page opened**
- Be more specific with the service name
- Check which card is highlighted
- Report the issue so we can improve matching

**Q: Voice commands not detected**
- Check microphone is working (look for waveform animation)
- Make sure conversation is active (green "End Conversation" button)
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
